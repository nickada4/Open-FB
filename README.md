**Synopsis:** 
In a similar way that WordPress liberates web site creation to the masses, the plan is to have an super-streamline type of installation that allows the creation of a social media profile. The installation is envisioned to be self-hosted on CloudStorage or hosted by ThirdParties. 

**Advantages:**
	- No need for massive servers.
	- Prevents any single cooporation controlling Social Media to interfere with elections.
	- Will create a better end user SocialMedia experience by introducing competition both aginast Facebook and also between ThirdParties.

**Key Aspects:**
	- MainSite: This is where people can register their username and credentials.
	- Connectivity: This allows for users to search for other registered users and sync data to see each others posts.
	- NewFeeds: This will be outsorced to the FreeMarket for ThirdParties to fill. (See ThirdParties below.)
	- Hosting: This can be Self-Hosted via CloudStorage, or on TradionalServers (like WordPress). ThirdParties may also offer Hosting included.
	- Tagging and upvoting on Tags to allow filtering by ThirdParties based on UserVoting.

**ThirdParties:**
You will be able to log into a ThirdParty website to view your NewsFeed.
ThirdParties will compete with each other for users.
For example, if a ThirdParty is showing too many ads in your NewsFeed then you can change to another ThirdParty.
ThirdParties can link to you SelfHosted Profile which is synced to your friends Profiles to create your NewsFeed.
Some ThirdParties can offer free hosting included with using Open-FB with using their service.
Some ThirdParties may allow you to use other ThirdParties concurrently. Some may restrict this if they are providing hosting.
One rule to be enforced on ThirdParties is that they must provide the clients data if the client wishes to migrate.
The aim is that competion between the ThirdParties will drive development of better quality services. 
Niche ThirdParties will be created to offer specilised functions, for example a ThirdParty may focus on ensuring screened Content and Secuirty for young users. 

**Administration:**
*Users can flag/downvote users. Reords will be kept for ThirdParties use. For example if a user is repeatedly Flagged for Hate Speech then you might use a ThirdParty who filters HateSpeech. Or you may choose a free speech ThirdParty that offers no restrictions. Users will have choice.

**Tasks:**
	- Create installation package to control one's profile and share.
			- Create a trasnferable and downlaoded file with entire profile.
	- Create Integrations with CloudStorage providers.
	- Create Transfer Protocol/API to communicate between different hosted profiles for viewing, commenting, chatting.
	- Create MainSite and Registration Databse and credentials and storing UserVoting
	- Create REgistration of ThirdParties to allow Data sharing to ThirdParties.


**Problems to Solve:**
	- **Faebook Migration** - People maybe relucant to change if they can't easily keep their photos and friendslist and chat history.
	- **Initial Traction** - People won't join if there aren't other users. Perhaps an initial Facebook integraton until it gets shut down. Perhaps targeting a niche group to begin with, for example it could be the FreeSpeech version of Facebook, where people can go who are being restricted. Or it could be the SafePlace version of Facebook and after some public incident on Facebook then people could come. Or perhaps it could be the Privacy Conscious Facebook for people who don't like Facebook spying on them. Or Perhaps it could be the be a specific group, maybe people who live somewhere Facebook is banned, or for gammer or programmers or the young people whose parents are on Facebook.
