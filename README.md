# Open-FB
**Self-Hosted Free Market Facebook**

**Objective:**
To replace the monopoly which Facebook has over social media.
To create a platform which delivers choices to end users about how their media is presented and how it is hosted.
To allow free market competition between ThirdParties to drive innovation.

**Synopsis:** 
WordPress is a large installation that allows users to create an entire Website, but the plan for Open-FB is to have an super-streamline type of installation that has a template of a Social Media page. The installation is to be installed on self-hosted CloudStorage or hosted by ThirdParties. 
A MainSite where users can register and enter the conenction details so their installation is visible accorss the network.
Third PArty websites will be able to register to offer News Feed services. The user will choose a Third PArty that is offering the right balance of ads, filtering and services, and then connect their self hosted site to a Third PArty site. The user will then log into the The Third PArty site to view their news feed.

**Advantages:**
* No need for massive servers.
* Prevents any single cooporation controlling Social Media to interfere with elections.
* Will create a better end user SocialMedia experience by introducing competition between ThirdParties.

**Why it isn't just another Social Media Platform**
1 **Publisher v Provider**: Facebook will one day go to far and run afoul of regulators and will be classed as a publisher. Open-FB hosts no content and just connects users, so it will always be classed as a Platform.
2 **Privacy** Facebook already collects your location and who you call. open-FB _assumes_ that users will become uncomforatbale with unaccountable Companies having access to all fo their data. Open-FB allows.
3 **De-Monopolization**  _assumption_


**Key Aspects:**
* MainSite: This is where people can register their username and credentials.
* Connectivity: This allows for users to search for other registered users and sync data to see each others posts.
* NewFeeds: This will be outsorced to the FreeMarket for ThirdParties to fill. (See ThirdParties below.)
* Hosting: This can be Self-Hosted via CloudStorage, or on TradionalServers (like WordPress). ThirdParties may also offer Hosting included.
* Tagging and upvoting on Tags to allow filtering by ThirdParties based on UserVoting.

**ThirdParties:**
You will be able to log into a ThirdParty website to view your NewsFeed.
ThirdParties will compete with each other for users.
For example, if a ThirdParty is showing too many ads in your NewsFeed then you can change to another ThirdParty.
ThirdParties can link to you SelfHosted Profile which is synced to your friends Profiles to create your NewsFeed.
Some ThirdParties can offer free hosting included with using Open-FB with using their service.
Some ThirdParties may allow you to use other ThirdParties concurrently. Some may restrict this if they are providing hosting.
One rule to be enforced on ThirdParties is that they must provide the clients data if the client wishes to migrate.
The aim is that competion between the ThirdParties will drive development of better quality services. 
Niche ThirdParties will be created to offer specilised functions, for example a ThirdParty may focus on ensuring screened Content and Secuirty for young users. 

**Privacy**
* **Self-Hosting** Security and Privacy conscious users can host their profile in CloudStorage like sync.com with zero-knowledge storage and end-to-end encryption. Also the use of comunication between sites via TOR if desired will maintian privacy.
* **Third-Party Hosting** ThirdsParties can offer different levels of security and users can choose a ThirdParty that is offering the level which they require.

**Administration:**
Users can flag/downvote users. Reords will be kept for ThirdParties use. For example if a user is repeatedly Flagged for Hate Speech then you might use a ThirdParty who filters HateSpeech. Or you may choose a free speech ThirdParty that offers no restrictions. Users will have choice.

**Tasks:**
* Create installation package to control one's profile and share.
	- Create a trasnferable and downlaoded file with entire profile.
* Create Integrations with CloudStorage providers.
* Create Transfer Protocol/API to communicate between different hosted profiles for viewing, commenting, chatting.
* Create MainSite and Registration Databse and credentials and storing UserVoting
* Create Registration of ThirdParties to allow Data sharing to ThirdParties.


**Problems to Solve:**
* **Faebook Migration** - People maybe relucant to change if they can't easily keep their photos and friendslist and chat history.
* **Initial Traction** - People won't join if there aren't other users. Perhaps an initial Facebook integraton until it gets shut down. Perhaps targeting a niche group to begin with, for example it could be the FreeSpeech version of Facebook, where people can go who are being restricted. Or it could be the SafePlace version of Facebook and after some public incident on Facebook then people could come. Or perhaps it could be the Privacy Conscious Facebook for people who don't like Facebook spying on them. Or Perhaps it could be the be a specific group, maybe people who live somewhere Facebook is banned, or for gammer or programmers or the young people whose parents are on Facebook.
